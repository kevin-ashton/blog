# A Blog Platform

I've played with a lot of blog software during my day. Eventually all of it becomes old, stale, and a pain to update.  For a change I thought I'd just do something simple. As I considered my options it occurred to me that Github pages had most of the features I wanted including the following:

*	Syntax highlighting for different programming languages
*	Nice simple markdown language
* Ability to load custom javascript and styles
*	Online editor
*	Will be around for a long time
*	Little to no maintenance or cost
*	I own and control the data
*	Comment system of sometime (easy enough to do disques if I want)

Given that criteria Github pages seem like a pretty good fit. So unlike previous blogs I've done in the past I'm hopeful that this one will last longer. Even if no one ever reads these words there is something therapeutic and educational about writing out ones thoughts.
